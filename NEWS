CHANGES IN VERSION 1.99.3
-------------------------
    o Bugfix for contig names containing certain characters
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.99.2
-------------------------
    o Update of the plot functions to support colorring aberrant status based 
      on p values computed on subsets of genes
      
-------------------------
    o Major update to FRASER2:
        o Introduction of new & more robust splice metric Intron Jaccard Index
        o Only Intron Jaccard Index metric used by default    
        o Improved gene level pvalue calculation and internal storage
        o Introduction of option to limit FDR correction to user-defined 
          subsets of genes per sample (e.g. OMIM genes with rare variant)
        o Updated internal pseudocount parameter and default delta Jaccard 
          cutoff    
        o Junction filtering adapted to usage of Intron Jaccard Index metric
            o Require min expression of N >= 10 in 25% of the samples
        o Results table:
            o Functionality to flag outliers in blacklist regions of the genome
            o Functionality to annotate the predicted type of aberrantSplicing 
              (e.g. exon skipping, intron retention etc.)
        o Several updates in the plotting functions    
            o introduction of manhattan plot functionality
            o possibility to create sashimi plots to visualize read coverage in 
              the bam files for outliers

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.8.1
-------------------------
    o Bugfix in merging splicing counts (#41)

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.6.1
-------------------------
    o Fixing quantile filtering defaults (#28)
        o Require min expression in 5% instead of 95% of the samples
        o Require min expression on both sides of the junction
    o Align FRASER package with DROP pipeline (#24)
    o Move temp directory from tempdir() to working directory getwd() (#35)
    o Improve visualizations and Improve documentation
    o Improve internal object validation
    o Minor bugfixes (eg. #37)

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.1
    o Add merging of external counts
    o Add publication
    o Minor bugfixes 
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.6
-------------------------
    o Use proper S3/S4 methods to share functions between packages
    o Minor API changes due to S3/S4 changes (e.g fds -> object)
    o Switch from psiSite to theta
    o Improved documentation
    o Minor bugfixes

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.3
-------------------------

    o Update and adjust injectOutlier and hyperParameter functions
    o Option to compute z scores in logit space or not
    o Add cap value [0.01,0.99] to logit function
    o Use pairedEnd counting with Rsubread
    o Correct assayName pajd -> padj
    o Minor bugfixes

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.2
-------------------------

    o Option to consider only the standard chromosomes in the counting
    o Option to include additional columns from mcols(fds) in the result table
    o Annotation of junctions with corresponding gene names/ids now produces 
      an additional column in mcols(fds) that contains further gene names/ids 
      if the junction overlaps with multiple genes
    o Minor bugfixes 

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.1
-------------------------

    o Bugfix correcting the strand specific counting for paired-end reads

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.1
-------------------------

    o Introduction of the shinyApp
