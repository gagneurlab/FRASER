FRASER is a tool to detect aberrant splicing events in RNA-seq data. The method is described and published in [Nature Communications](https://doi.org/doi:10.1038/s41467-020-20573-7) and available t[...] 

The FRASER framework and workflow aims to assist the diagnostics in the field of rare diseases where RNA-seq is performed to identify aberrant splicing defects. For a short tutorial on how to use [...]
