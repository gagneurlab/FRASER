\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{\link{FraserDataSet}} object}

\item{sampleIDs}{A vector of sample IDs for which results should be 
retrieved}

\item{padjCutoff}{The FDR cutoff to be applied or NA if not requested.}

\item{zScoreCutoff}{The z-score cutoff to be applied or NA if not requested.}

\item{deltaPsiCutoff}{The cutoff on delta psi or NA if not requested.}

\item{minCount}{The minimum count value of the total coverage of an intron 
to be considered as significant.
result}

\item{psiType}{The psi types for which the results should be retrieved.}

\item{additionalColumns}{Character vector containing the names of additional 
columns from mcols(fds) that should appear in the result table 
(e.g. ensembl_gene_id). Default is \code{NULL}, so no additional columns 
are included.}

\item{BPPARAM}{The BiocParallel parameter.}

\item{...}{Further arguments can be passed to the method. If "zscores", 
"padjVals" or "dPsi" is given, the values of those arguments
are used to define the aberrant events.}

\item{res}{Result as created with \code{results()}}

\item{geneColumn}{The name of the column in \code{mcols(res)} that contains 
the gene symbols.}

\item{method}{The p.adjust method that is being used to adjust p values per
sample.}

\item{type}{Splicing type (psi5, psi3 or psiSite)}

\item{by}{By default \code{none} which means no grouping. But if 
\code{sample} or \code{feature} is specified the sum by 
sample or feature is returned}

\item{aggregate}{If TRUE the returned object is based on the grouped 
features}
}
\value{
For \code{results}: GRanges object containing significant results.
    For \code{aberrant}: Either a of logical values of size 
    introns/genes x samples if "by" is NA or a vector with the 
    number of aberrant events per sample or feature depending on 
    the vaule of "by"
}
\description{
The result function extracts the results from the given analysis object
based on the given options and cutoffs. The aberrant function extracts 
aberrant splicing events based on the given cutoffs.
}
\examples{
# get data, fit and compute p-values and z-scores
fds <- createTestFraserDataSet()

# extract results: for this example dataset, z score cutoff of 2 is used to
# get at least one result and show the output
res <- results(fds, padjCutoff=NA, zScoreCutoff=3, deltaPsiCutoff=0.05)
res

# aggregate the results by genes (gene symbols need to be annotated first 
# using annotateRanges() function)
resultsByGenes(res)

# get aberrant events per sample: on the example data, nothing is aberrant
# based on the adjusted p-value
aberrant(fds, type="psi5", by="sample")

# get aberrant events per gene (first annotate gene symbols)
fds <- annotateRangesWithTxDb(fds)
aberrant(fds, type="psi5", by="feature", zScoreCutoff=2, padjCutoff=NA,
        aggregate=TRUE)
        
# find aberrant junctions/splice sites
aberrant(fds, type="psi5")
